        Meet the Team

      <p>
        Our team members have honed their skills at industry giants like{' '}
        <span className="font-bold">KPMG</span> and{' '}
        <span className="font-bold">Microsoft</span>. They bring a wealth of
        experience and maybe a few good stories. While we could list every
        Fortune 500 company on their résumés, we'd rather let their work speak
        for itself.
