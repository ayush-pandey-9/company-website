        At <span className="uppercase font-bold">Emeris</span>, we're not just
        another AI agency chasing the latest trends. Sure, we can build chatbots
        (they're kind of like the avocado toast of AIâ€”everyone does them), but
        we focus on delivering real, impactful solutions that make a difference
        in your day-to-day operations. Our team brings experience from top
        companies like KPMG and Microsoft. We could name-drop a few more Fortune
        500s, but we don't want to brag (or bore you).
