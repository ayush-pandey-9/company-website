        At <span className="uppercase font-bold">Emeris</span>, we're not just
        another AI agency chasing the latest trends. Sure, we can build chatbots
        (they're kind of like the avocado toast of AI—everyone does them), but
        we focus on delivering real, impactful solutions that make a difference
        in your day-to-day operations. Our team brings experience from top
        companies like KPMG and Microsoft. We could name-drop a few more Fortune
        500s, but we don't want to brag (or bore you).
